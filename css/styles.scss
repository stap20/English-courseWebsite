                future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the
                tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at the
                supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion

                <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal
                for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering
